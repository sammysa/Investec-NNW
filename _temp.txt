Benefits of Using Predicates:
Separation of Concerns:

Encapsulation of Logic: Each predicate encapsulates a specific validation rule, making the code modular and easier to understand. Each predicate can be tested independently.
Reusability: Predicates can be reused in different parts of the code if similar validation logic is needed elsewhere.
Declarative Style:

Readability: The declarative style often improves readability by clearly expressing the intention of the code. The validation logic reads more like a series of checks rather than a sequence of control flow statements.
Functional Composition: Predicates can be composed using logical operations (e.g., and, or, negate), which can simplify complex validation logic.
Extensibility:

Adding New Rules: Adding new validation rules becomes simpler. You can define a new predicate and include it in the validation process without modifying the existing control flow.
Maintenance: Maintenance is easier because each predicate is a small, focused piece of logic. Changes to validation rules are localized.
Reduction of Control Flow Statements:

Less Control Flow Overhead: By reducing if statements, the code avoids the overhead of managing control flow explicitly. This can lead to cleaner and more concise code.
